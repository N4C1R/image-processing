## Rotating Images
Rotate an image using the OpenCV library. The script allows you to specify the rotation angle and visualize the original and rotated images.
```bash
python rotation.py
```

## Affine Transformations
Perform affine transformations such as scaling and translation on an image using OpenCV. The script demonstrates the effect of these transformations on the original image.
```bash
python affineTransformation.py
```

## Interpolation Schemes
Resize an image using different interpolation methods, including zero-order interpolation, bilinear interpolation, and higher-order interpolation.
```bash
python interpolationMethods.py
```

## Warping
Morph one image into another by defining corresponding points in both images. The script illustrates a smooth transition between a source and target image.
```bash
python warp.py
```

## Morphing
Morph one image into another by defining corresponding points in both images. The script illustrates a smooth transition between a source and target image.
```bash
python morphing.py
```

## Gray Level & Color Enhancement
Convert an image to grayscale and enhance its color using histogram equalization. The script demonstrates the impact on the original image.
```bash
python grayLevelAndColorEnhancement.py
```

## Edge Detection
Apply edge detection using the Sobel operator for gradient calculation and Laplacian for edge detection. The script visualizes the original, gradient, and Laplacian images.
```bash
python edgeDetection.py
```

## Erosion & Dilation
Perform morphological operations such as erosion and dilation on a binary image. The script showcases the effects of these operations on the original and binary images.
```bash
python ErosionAndDilation.py
```
